There are very few interesting things that can be accomplished by a lone person. Even if you were able to have meaningful impact without help from others, you still need the ability to get your projects greenlit. The best way to ensure you can deliver results and make lasting, meaningful change in your organization is to forge strong relationships with those around you. Your network is also the best tool you have in finding your dream position or dealing with being laid off in tough economic times.

Relationships are built through regular connection. As a rule of thumb, you should be connecting with people in your network at least once a quarter.

# Network not networking
Using the term ‘network’ conjures images of smarmy businessmen in sharkskin suits trying to trick you into a used car but that is not the intention of this guidance. The goal is to build and maintain a large (100+) set of strong relationships. Rather than approaching each relationship as a way to get something out of the other person, focus on building the relationships and the benefits will come naturally.

## How to build and maintain your network
So, if growing your network is not just going to "networking" events then what does it consist of? There are five core steps in building and maintaining a strong network:
1.	Add people indiscriminately
2.	Connect regularly and bring genuine interest in the other person
3.	Give
4.	Receive
5.	Be a connector

### Add people indiscriminately
The first step in growing a network is to identify people to add to it. The best part is there should be very little filtering criteria. Rather than assessing what someone is able to do for you at this time (or at any other) you should just focus on building the relationship anyways. As you will see below the ‘cost’ of having someone in your network is on the order of minutes in a year so there is very little risk in adding everyone you meet because you never know what situations you will find yourself in.

There are only two traits I consider to be deal breakers: malicious intent and callous disregard for you or others. Anything else and behavior can be understood as someone not knowing or understanding. If you see either of those behaviors then that person is not worth the time investment to keep in your life (regardless of the power they may wield.)

### Connect regularly and bring genuine interest in the other person
Once you have decided someone is going to be part of your network what do you do to make that a reality? You find time regularly (at minimum four times a year) to connect with them. Connection could be as lightweight as a text, IM, or voicemail or could involve grabbing coffee, going out to dinner, etc. Use your recurrence system (either your task or time system) to track these so that you have regular reminders to reach out.

### Give and Receive
We will deep dive on the value and power of giving a receiving in the next section but for now know that one of the best ways to forge strong relationships is to find opportunities to share with others and to give others opportunities to give back to you.

### Be a connector
As you grow your network a new ability will start to appear. You will start to see opportunities where one person in your network has a problem (and you will know this because you will connect with them regularly enough to hear about it) and someone else you know has the skills or abilities to help solve that issue. When this happens, you have a unique opportunity to be a connector. For the person with the problem this will seem like a force multiplication of your abilities because they now not only get access to what you know but all of the value that your network holds. I recommend making the connection by sending an email with the two parties on the To and stating the situation briefly. It is traditional to thank and BCC the connector at the first exchange unless there is some value in their continuing in the conversation. Let us look at an example:

> Hi Pavan,
>
>Jessica is looking for a commercial realtor in the south bay area for a grocery expansion project and I thought you two would have a great time working together.
>
>Jessica – Pavan is the fantastic realtor I told you about that helped me close the deal on our new location a few months back.
>
>Thanks!

# Where to focus your time
While I recommend putting in time with everyone in your network there are some people who are necessarily more important and need additional time and attention that a once quarterly contact will not fulfill.

## The cornerstone relationship: Your direct manager

The single most important and impactful relationship you have is with your direct manager. They have the most direct ability to impact your daily life in a work environment and as such that relationship requires a necessarily larger part of your time and attention. Ideally your manager is already doing weekly one-on-one meetings with you but if they are not taking the initiative then it is up to you to request time. The goal of these meetings is to discuss work in progress, prioritization of the work you have, and longer-term career goals, coaching, feedback etc. Generally, you should shoot for 30 minutes, 15 of which are your time to talk and 15 of which are dedicated to your manager.
