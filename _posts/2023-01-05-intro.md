This site is dedicated to giving you actionable recommondations for ways to succeed as a knowlege worker.

The core of the site is a writing project I've titled 'Intellectual Craftsmanship'.

## Why I wrote this

Repeatedly I have seen people new in their careers join the corporate world and struggle to get a foothold. Too often this happens because no one is providing concrete and actionable tools to help people succeed. Most people are left to sort out the right and wrong ways of doing things on their own, relying only on sparse feedback to adjust how they approach problems.

While the skills learned in an academic setting do translate there are major differences especially when transitioning from mostly individual work to working with a team.
The major reason people are not given more help by their more experienced coworkers is that people worry that if they give advice, it will not work in every scenario. You will find that to be the case in this book as well. My goal in writing this book is to provide an answer not the answer. Once you have learned and internalized these rules you can build on them and hone them to fit your personal style of work and the circumstances you find yourself in but in the meantime, you will have concrete action to take.

The guidence consists of three main areas.

We will focus first on personal productivity. I'll outline a set of tools for dealing with information. One of the main hallmarks of a professional is to be able to deal with large volumes of incoming information and deftly turn it into the right action. We will talk about the theoretical parts of a good information management process and then go deep on specific implementations to help you deal with the massive amount of data, tasks, and information you come across every day in your corporate life.

After breaking down the core systems of personal productivity we will turn our attention to some core behaviors I believe to be essential to being a good and ethical professional. This guidance is designed to multiply the impact you can have as an individual and make your work life more enjoyable.

Finally, we will talk about the cornerstone of a successful career: Communication. Learning to communicate with others with clarity and in a way that they can understand is one of the largest boosts you can give to a career.

This is the advice I give my friends and I hope it can be as helpful to you as it has been to me.

## How to use the site
This site is designed around a tree strucuture (something I strongly recommend when talking about clear and effective communication). Each page will highlight where it lives in the tree to help you understand where you are conceptually.

Each page also provides links to the previous and next page (in a depth first order.)

Here is the full page tree. Each page gives you the path from this introduction to that leaf. The charts are all linked to allow you to quickly navigate from this introduction to whatever topic you are interested in (although generally I recommend at least reading the pages that come before reaching a given topic in the tree to help you contextulize the content.)

## If you don't like reading online
I put this content on a site for three reasons:

1. I wanted to have a free place that anyone with interest could come to to learn this content
2. I wanted to have a way to keep a living version of this project where I can add and adjust as I learn more
3. The searchability and hyperlinked nature of the ideas allows for more expressive interaction with the content

I also recognize that not everyone enjoys reading on the web (myself included) so I will also be making a snapshoted version of this content available both as an ebook and as print-on-demand in the near future.
